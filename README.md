This is a project for the course CS554 - Software Engineering with Daniel LeBlanc.

KungligaRPG is an application which acts as a character sheet. Allowing user input
to keep track of a player's stats and abilities while playing the game.

The main languages are C# and XAML in the .NET Maui framework. In large part I am
using these languages as I am deeply familiar with C# and other C based languages.
Ideally this will help me to increase performance, speed of progress and code
extensibility and maintainability. .NET Maui is a relatively common framework used
for desktop applications. Additionally, I am familiar with the syntax and structure
of C#, XAML, and Maui. Which will help me create something meaningful over the
course of a short timeframe.
